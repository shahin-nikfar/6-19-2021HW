## Code refactoring assignment

The assignment was to take a premade website, for a marketing agency, and clean up the code.  Refactoring the code of a website involves cleaning up the html with semantic tags, comments and cleaner indents.  It also requires cleaning up the CSS stylesheet by organizing element, class and id selectors.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Conclusion

In order to finish this assignment I added semantic html tags to allow for more accessibility, and increasing the searchability of the site.  I also consolidated much of the CSS into more consice elements and classes and IDs, eliminating redundancy.
